I felt sorry for all those who don't yet have a [Google
Wave](http://wave.google.com/) account, and I was impressed with their
demo. And I also wanted an [Erlang](http://www.erlang.org) project.

So I killed three birds with one stone. I made Lightwave. It's like
Google Wave only:

* Dumber
* Buggier
* Uglier
* More incomplete
* Written in Erlang

<blargh:body/>

## Future plans include

* API for hooking in bots
* Only save data for last X time or entries
* Automatic on-disk persistence

## Links

* [Lightwave on Github](http://github.com/ThomasHabets/lightwave)
* [Lightwave "technology preview" :-)](http://blog.habets.pp.se/lightwave/)
