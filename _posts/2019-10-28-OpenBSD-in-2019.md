I've used OpenBSD on and off since 2.1. More back then than in the
last 10 years or so though, so I thought I'd try it again.

What triggered this was me finding [a silly bug in GNU cpio that has
existed with a "FIXME" comment since at least 1994][cpio-bug]. I
checked OpenBSD to see if it had a related bug, but as expected no it
was just fine.

I don't quite remember why I stopped using OpenBSD for servers, but I
do remember filesystem corruption on "unexpected power disconnections"
(even with [softdep][softdep] turned on), which I've never really seen
on Linux.

That and that fewer things "just worked" than with Linux, which
matters more when I installed more random things than I do now. I've
become a lot more minimalist. Probably due to less spare time. Life is
better when you don't run things like PHP (not that OpenBSD doesn't
support PHP, just an example) or your own email server with various
antispam tooling, and other things.

This is all experience from running OpenBSD on a server. On my next
laptop I intend to try running OpenBSD on the desktop, and will see if
that more ad-hoc environment works well. E.g. will
[gnuradio][gnuradio] work? Lack of other-OS VM support may be a
problem.

## How to run OpenBSD in 2019

The easiest way to run servers nowadays is to just rent VMs on public
clouds. Unfortunately most clouds don't support
OpenBSD. [Vultr][vultr] does, and they're pretty good. They have
IPv6-only VMs (US locations only) that are only $2.50/month
($3.50/month with IPv4). They also, unlike some other cloud vendors,
give access to the actual console, which is very helpful.

I installed OpenBSD 6.5 (the newest, at the time), and tried it
out.

## The good

* Security mindset. Should go without saying, but it's a perfectly
  usable Unix system that places security first. They may not be first
  (e.g. took them years to reinvent W^X behind Linux), but they were
  the first to turn on the features by default, and you can trust them
  to continue to do so. E.g. who else bothers to link a unique kernel
  per system?

* Ports and packages end up in `/usr/local`, and anything outside that
  either *you* put there, or it's the base system. Sure, it means
  `/usr/local` may be a bit of a mess, but *outside* of it isn't.

* It's clear what base system you're running. Kernel and everything is
  plainly "6.6" (or whatever). Well... plus any `syspatch` fixes.

* Upgrading the system to OpenBSD 6.6 was easy. I had my fears, but it
  was about as easy as installing. I used the classic method that
  requires taking the server out of commission and console access, for
  running the installer. But with 6.5->6.6 they've created
  `sysupgrade` that can do this on a live system.

* The init system has gotten start/stop scripts, in `/etc/rc.d`. From
  what I remember `/etc/rc` used to be one big start script, with no
  good way to restart services without remembering what took a HUP,
  what wanted its own tool, etc...

* Most things just worked. My Go code worked fine. Well, except for
  [an annoying bug in Go's `sys/unix` and `syscall` libraries][gobug],
  that (like the GNU cpio bug) is not a great sign of quality.

* Modern enough clang to support C++17. The GCC version is stuck in
  the stone age because of licensing, but clang is a worthy
  replacement now. Development should be good here.

* Since [I'd fixed some MPLS code a long time ago][mplsfixes] I read
  through [the MPLS forwarding code][mplscode]. Like when I checked
  OpenBSD's `cpio` code I found it of very high quality, with APIs
  designed such that it's hard to use them incorrectly, or to leak
  resources.

* I generally find the OpenBSD manpages to be of higher quality than
  GNU ones. Also nice to have man section 9 (kernel internals)
  installed by default.

## The bad

It's less smooth to use. It lacks many convenience options in
tools. Some examples:

* Upgrading has a bunch of manual cleanup steps. Edit: you can install
  package `sysclean`, which will do this for you. But you have to
  install and run it yourself, as opposed to being part of the
  upgrade.

* I can reliably crash it by using too much RAM. Completely freezes
  it, even the console and not answering `ping`. I don't know if this
  is OpenBSD's fault, or a result of it being in a VM, or something on
  Vultr's side. Adding some more swap helped, but that just delays the
  problem.

* On my Vultr system there was no default package repo path, so I had
  to choose a mirror myself and set `PKG_PATH`. And since I'm on an
  IPv6-only VM I had to check a few before finding one that had an
  IPv6 address. Unclear if this was OpenBSD or Vultr's misconfig,
  because apparently it's supposed to "just work" by having
  `/etc/installurl` point to a mirror but on Vultr it's empty.

* `find` requires a path argument. I don't see why it can't default to
  `.` like on Linux.

* `du` doesn't take a `-m` switch. Workaround is `BLOCKSIZE=1000000 du
  -cs *` which is not as friendly for numerical sorting.

* which brings me to: if the correction to SI units was lacking in Linux
  it's completely absent in OpenBSD. I'm guessing they've chosen not to.

* OpenBSD's `tar` can't read `/etc/spwd.db` due to security features,
  which is great and all, but prevents backing up `/etc` and being
  able to check exit code for success of everything else. It also
  doesn't support exclusion or inclusion lists. I would have changed
  my portable backupscripts to `cpio`, but because GNU cpio has the
  bug mentioned earlier I can't. OpenBSD's default shell (ksh) has
  support for glob exclusions, [as does bash][bashnot]. But it's not a
  great solution (cmdline length for one, and this could be its own
  blog post so I'll stop here). Luckily you can install GNU tar as a
  package and use that.

* TCP MD5 seems to be implemented as system-wide settings. It's
  understandable but I don't like it. More on that [here][tcpmd5].

* After upgrading to OpenBSD 6.6 random shellscripts started
  failing. Turns out `/bin/sh` [could't handle large
  `HISTSIZE`][shbug] that I had set for bash, and it just aborts the
  shell if set too high, instead of making do with less history. The
  developers were very responsive and [it's been fixed now][shfix],
  but still needs to be improved a bit further, as they pointed out.

* While the manpages are good, the source code is not very well
  commented. I agree that good code doesn't need "what does it do",
  but it does need "why". Specifically what I found missing were:

  * What is an "environment" in ksh? What is its purpose?

  * Why is ksh using its own allocator?

* I found [a bug][mplsbug] in the first part of the kernel I looked
  at. Not a serious one, but still.

* `acme-client` (at least in 6.5) doesn't work with IPv6-only
  machines. I fixed the first step by replacing a `PF_UNSPEC` with
  `PF_INET6`, but then the next step failed so I switched to certbot.

* There are some Linux-only things. Pov-Ray 3.7, in addition to since
  3.6 switching to the terrible AGPL, switched to build scripts that
  only work on Linux. This sucks for my [distributed render
  project][drender].

* Postgresql was a bit awkward to set up, since the unix user is
  `_postgresql`, but the postgres user is `postgres`. Adding `export
  PGUSER=postgres` to `~_postgresql/.profile` seemed like the best
  fix. You also [have to `initdb` the database yourself][initdb].

* The equivalent to [`strace`][strace],
  [`ktrace`][ktrace]/[`kdump`][kdump], is a two-step process, and does
  not produce as good output.

* No checksumming filesystem in sight.

* Less binary compatability. Linux is strict on not breaking
  userspace, but OpenBSD seems less so. Seems the old [dnetc][dnetc]
  binaries don't work on a modern OpenBSD system, for example.

* The general OpenBSD attitude. Read the last paragraph of [this
  FAQ][gotfaq] and tell me you feel like this is a system and people
  that care about your use cases. It really says that this is *their*
  OS, and if you happen to be able to run it then good for you.

## Verdict

Ouch, that's a long list of bad stuff. Still, I like it. I'll continue
to run it, and will make sure [my stuff][mystuff] continues working on
OpenBSD.

And maybe in a year I'll have a review of OpenBSD on a laptop.
