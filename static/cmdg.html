     <p>
       cmdg is a commandline client to GMail that provides a UI more
       similar to Pine/Alpine.
     </p>
     <p>
       cmdg is open source with the
       code <a href="https://github.com/ThomasHabets/cmdg">available
       on github</a>. See that project page for installation
       and setup instructions.
     </p>
     <p>
       It uses the GMail API to interact with your mailbox. This has
       several benefits.
     </p>

     <h3>Benefits over IMAP</h3>
     <p>
       <ul>
         <li>
           No passwords stored on disk. (application-specific
           passwords are also passwords, and can be used for more than
           GMail). OAuth2 is used instead, and cmdgs access can be
           revoked
           <a href="https://security.google.com/settings/security/permissions">here</a>.
           cmdg can only access your GMail, and cannot lose your
           password even if the machine it runs on gets hacked.
         </li>
         <li>
           The "labels" model is native in the cmdg UI, unlike IMAP
           clients that try to map GMail labels onto IMAP.
         </li>
         <li>Contacts are taken from your Google contacts</li>
       </ul>
     </p>

     <h3> Benefits over the GMail web UI</h3>
     <p>
       <ul>
         <li>
           Emacs-ish keys. If there's a need the key mapping can be
           made configurable.
         </li>
         <li>Uses a real $EDITOR.</li>
         <li>
           Really fast. No browser, CSS, or javascript getting in the
           way.
         </li>
         <li>
           Proper quoting. The GMail web UI encourages
           top-posting. Ugh
         </li>
         <li>
           It uses 100% keyboard navigation. GMail web UI has very
           good keyboard navigation for a web app, but still requires
           mouse for a few things
         </li>
         <li>cmdg works without a graphic terminal</li>
         <li>
           cmdg uses less bandwidth (citation needed), and much less
           memory
         </li>
         <li>
           Local GPG integration. There are currently no *good* ways
           to integrate GPG with the GMail web UI
         </li>
       </ul>
     </p>

     <p>
       Google OAuth consent screen requires a home page and privacy
       policy, so this is it.

     <a name="privacy"><h2>cmdg Privacy policy</h2></a>

     <h3>What data cmdg accesses</h3>
     <p>
       <ul>
         <li>Your emails when you read them</li>
         <li>Your emails when you write them</li>
         <li>Your contacts in order to help you send email to them</li>
         <li>Its own settings in a hidden Google Drive folder</li>
       </ul>
     </p>

     <h3>What data cmdg shares</h3>
     <p>
       Emails you send with cmdg are sent to your recipients via the
       GMail API, exactly what you'd expect.
     </p>
     <p>
       In plain words: This is an email client you run on your own
       machine as an interface to the GMail API. It won't upload your
       emails anywhere for "processing" by any third party. Your emails
       just go between you on your machine and your GMail account.
     </p>

     <h3>What data cmdg stores</h3>
     <p>
       If cmdg fails to send an email for you (for example due to a
       network outage), it give you the option to save the draft to your
       local hard drive.
     </p>
     <p>
       Settings, such as your email signature, is saved in Google Drive
       for you in your account, and nobody else is given access to such
       settings.
     </p>
     <p>
       cmdg never stores any data outside of your Google account (and
       doesn't grant access to anyone else), and only sends data
       anywhere, and then only to the recipient, when you choose to send
       an email.
     </p>
     <p>
       The only thing stored locally is the OAuth access tokens, just
       like how Chrome has access tokens to browse to mail.google.com.
     </p>

     <h3>How cmdg uses your data</h3>
     <p>
       No ads, no sharing to third parties or to cmdg authors. Your data
       is only used and processed as required to read and write emails.
     </p>

     <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
     <p>
       This privacy policy will not substantially change, but if in
       order to provide a better email client by e.g. using more APIs
       cmdg processes more user data, it will be added to this page.
